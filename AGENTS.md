# Working in this repo

Read `README.md` first — it has the layout, the ports, and how each half is built and shipped.

## Svelte 5, not Svelte 4

The frontend is Svelte 5 in runes mode (`$state`, `$derived`, `$props`, `$effect`) on SvelteKit 2
with Tailwind CSS 4. Stores, `export let`, `on:click` and `tailwind.config.js` are all gone —
theme tokens live in `@theme` inside `src/app.css`. Check `node_modules/svelte/CHANGELOG.md` or the
docs before reaching for an API you remember.

## The app is a client-side SPA

`ssr` and `prerender` are off for every route (`src/routes/+layout.ts`) because the same bundle
runs inside a Capacitor webview, and everything on screen depends on a Clerk session that only
exists in the browser. Don't add server-side load functions, form actions, or `+server.ts` routes —
the API is Nitro, in `apps/backend`.

## Generated and committed

- `apps/frontend/src/lib/api-client/` is generated from the backend's routes (`bunx nitro-client`).
  Never hand-edit it; regenerate and commit.
- `apps/frontend/ios/` is a committed Xcode project, and holds everything Apple: `App/WatchApp`,
  `App/WatchWidget`, the `BalanceKit` package they share, and `fastlane/`. The watch app and widget
  targets are added by `ios/wire_watch_targets.rb`, which is idempotent — change the script, re-run
  it, and commit the resulting `project.pbxproj` rather than editing the project by hand.
